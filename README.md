# Egg Incubator Project
This egg incubator project is a DIY incubator designed to hatch chicken, duck, or quail eggs. It uses a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, and a microcontroller to maintain the optimal conditions for egg incubation.

## Materials
Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller board
DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor
Relay module
LCD display
5V power supply
Plastic container or box
LED lights
Fan
Water container

## Assembly
Build the circuit on a breadboard or PCB based on the circuit diagram.
Attach the temperature and humidity sensor and the waterproof temperature sensor to the inside of the incubator using adhesive tape.
Install the relay module to control the heating element and the fan.
Attach the LCD display to the top of the incubator for easy viewing.
Install LED lights inside the incubator to provide light for the eggs.
Add a water container to maintain humidity levels.
## Usage
Power on the incubator by connecting the 5V power supply.
Set the desired temperature and humidity levels using the buttons on the microcontroller.
Place the eggs inside the incubator and close the lid.
The microcontroller will control the temperature and humidity levels to maintain the optimal conditions for egg incubation.
Monitor the temperature and humidity levels using the LCD display and make adjustments as necessary.
